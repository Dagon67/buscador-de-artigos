        "title": "VideoMage: Multi-Subject and Motion Customization of Text-to-Video\n  Diffusion Models",
        "abstract": "Customized text-to-video generation aims to produce high-quality videos that\nincorporate user-specified subject identities or motion patterns. However,\nexisting methods mainly focus on personalizing a single concept, either subject\nidentity or motion pattern, limiting their effectiveness for multiple subjects\nwith the desired motion patterns. To tackle this challenge, we propose a\nunified framework VideoMage for video customization over both multiple subjects\nand their interactive motions. VideoMage employs subject and motion LoRAs to\ncapture personalized content from user-provided images and videos, along with\nan appearance-agnostic motion learning approach to disentangle motion patterns\nfrom visual appearance. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-temporal composition\nscheme to guide interactions among subjects within the desired motion patterns.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that VideoMage outperforms existing methods,\ngenerating coherent, user-controlled videos with consistent subject identities\nand interactions.",

        "abstract": "Video understanding models often struggle with high computational\nrequirements, extensive parameter counts, and slow inference speed, making them\ninefficient for practical use. To tackle these challenges, we propose\nMobile-VideoGPT, an efficient multimodal framework designed to operate with\nfewer than a billion parameters. Unlike traditional video large multimodal\nmodels (LMMs), Mobile-VideoGPT consists of lightweight dual visual encoders,\nefficient projectors, and a small language model (SLM), enabling real-time\nthroughput. To further improve efficiency, we present an Attention-Based Frame\nScoring mechanism to select the key-frames, along with an efficient token\nprojector that prunes redundant visual tokens and preserves essential\ncontextual cues. We evaluate our model across well-established six video\nunderstanding benchmarks (e.g., MVBench, EgoSchema, NextQA, and PercepTest).\nOur results show that Mobile-VideoGPT-0.5B can generate up to 46 tokens per\nsecond while outperforming existing state-of-the-art 0.5B-parameter models by 6\npoints on average with 40% fewer parameters and more than 2x higher throughput.\nOur code and models are publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/Amshaker/Mobile-VideoGPT.",

        "abstract": "Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) reconstruction is crucial for\ncapturing dynamic anatomical changes but faces inherent limitations from\nconventional phase-binning workflows. Current methods discretize temporal\nresolution into fixed phases with respiratory gating devices, introducing\nmotion misalignment and restricting clinical practicality. In this paper, We\npropose X$^2$-Gaussian, a novel framework that enables continuous-time 4D-CT\nreconstruction by integrating dynamic radiative Gaussian splatting with\nself-supervised respiratory motion learning. Our approach models anatomical\ndynamics through a spatiotemporal encoder-decoder architecture that predicts\ntime-varying Gaussian deformations, eliminating phase discretization. To remove\ndependency on external gating devices, we introduce a physiology-driven\nperiodic consistency loss that learns patient-specific breathing cycles\ndirectly from projections via differentiable optimization. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 9.93 dB PSNR\ngain over traditional methods and 2.25 dB improvement against prior Gaussian\nsplatting techniques. By unifying continuous motion modeling with hardware-free\nperiod learning, X$^2$-Gaussian advances high-fidelity 4D CT reconstruction for\ndynamic clinical imaging.

While effective, the existing VICL paradigm exhibits poor\ngeneralizability under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose test-time\nVisual In-Context Tuning (VICT), a method that can adapt VICL models on the fly\nwith a single test sample. Specifically, we flip the role between the task\nprompts and the test sample and use a cycle consistency loss to reconstruct the\noriginal task prompt output. Our key insight is that a model should be aware of\na new test distribution if it can successfully recover the original task\nprompts. Extensive experiments on six representative vision tasks ranging from\nhigh-level visual understanding to low-level image processing, with 15 common\ncorruptions, demonstrate that our VICT can improve the generalizability of VICL\nto unseen new domains.

        "abstract": "Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through\nrule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first\nattempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for eliciting video reasoning\nwithin multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL\ntraining with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary\nchallenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the\nscarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we\nfirst propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal\ninformation in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on\nvideo data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training\nprocess. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-COT-165k for SFT cold start\nand Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant\nimprovements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as\nwell as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc.\nNotably, Video-R1-7B attains a 35.8% accuracy on video spatial reasoning\nbenchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

        "abstract": "Underwater dense prediction, especially depth estimation and semantic\nsegmentation, is crucial for gaining a comprehensive understanding of\nunderwater scenes. Nevertheless, high-quality and large-scale underwater\ndatasets with dense annotations remain scarce because of the complex\nenvironment and the exorbitant data collection costs. This paper proposes a\nunified Text-to-Image and DEnse annotation generation method (TIDE) for\nunderwater scenes. It relies solely on text as input to simultaneously generate\nrealistic underwater images and multiple highly consistent dense annotations.\nSpecifically, we unify the generation of text-to-image and text-to-dense\nannotations within a single model. The Implicit Layout Sharing mechanism (ILS)\nand cross-modal interaction method called Time Adaptive Normalization (TAN) are\nintroduced to jointly optimize the consistency between image and dense\nannotations. We synthesize a large-scale underwater dataset using TIDE to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method in underwater dense prediction tasks.\nThe results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the performance of\nexisting underwater dense prediction models and mitigates the scarcity of\nunderwater data with dense annotations.

Despite this, their\ndeficiencies in physical cognition have gradually received widespread attention\n- generated content often violates the fundamental laws of physics, falling\ninto the dilemma of ''visual realism but physical absurdity\". Researchers began\nto increasingly recognize the importance of physical fidelity in video\ngeneration and attempted to integrate heuristic physical cognition such as\nmotion representations and physical knowledge into generative systems to\nsimulate real-world dynamic scenarios. Considering the lack of a systematic\noverview in this field, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive summary of\narchitecture designs and their applications to fill this gap. Specifically, we\ndiscuss and organize the evolutionary process of physical cognition in video\ngeneration from a cognitive science perspective, while proposing a three-tier\ntaxonomy: 1) basic schema perception for generation, 2) passive cognition of\nphysical knowledge for generation, and 3) active cognition for world\nsimulation, encompassing state-of-the-art methods, classical paradigms, and\nbenchmarks. Subsequently, we emphasize the inherent key challenges in this\ndomain and delineate potential pathways for future research, contributing to\nadvancing the frontiers of discussion in both academia and industry. Through\nstructured review and interdisciplinary analysis, this survey aims to provide\ndirectional guidance for developing interpretable, controllable, and physically\nconsistent video generation paradigms, thereby propelling generative models\nfrom the stage of ''visual mimicry'' towards a new phase of ''human-like\nphysical comprehension''.",

While this\nduality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string\nsector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results\nof [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire,\noff-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological\nstring partition functions. We focus on local $\\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror\ncurve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda\nlattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the\nquantum mirror curve for local $\\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified\nMathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our\nframework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the\ndifference equations associated with these operators.
